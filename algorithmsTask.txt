What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal way of writing algorithms using simple, human-readable language. It describes the steps of a solution without following the strict syntax of any programming language. Pseudocode focuses on logic and flow, not on code rules.

Why do we use Pseudocode?
We use pseudocode to understand and plan the logic of a problem before writing actual code. It helps programmers think clearly, avoid mistakes, and explain ideas easily to others without worrying about programming language syntax.

When do we use Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is used before coding, during the design and planning stage of an algorithm. It is especially useful when solving complex problems, learning programming, or communicating algorithms between team members.

How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm?
To write pseudocode for an algorithm, start by understanding the problem clearly. Then write the solution as a sequence of simple, logical steps using plain English words. Each step should be clear and written in order.
Use common keywords such as START, END, INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR to represent decisions and loops. Do not follow the syntax of any specific programming language. Focus on the logic of the algorithm, not on how the code is written.
Pseudocode should be easy to read, easy to understand, and structured in a way that clearly represents the flow of the algorithm.

Example on problem algorithm written in pseudo code
Example: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Problem:
Given a number, determine whether it is even or odd.
Algorithm CheckEvenOdd(number)

IF number mod 2 = 0 THEN
Return "Even"
ELSE
Return "Odd"
END IF
End Algorithm



Task 1
-input all numbers in list
-sum all the numbers to get total
-count how many numbers are in the list
-divide the total by the count to get average
-return results of average
-end algorithm

Task2:
-IF number mod 2 = 0 THEN
-Return "Even"
-ELSE
-Return "Odd"
-END IF
-End Algorithm

Task3:
-set the first number in the list as a smallest number
-for each number in list check if the number is lower than smallest update smallest to number
-end for 
-return smallest
-end Algorithm

Task4 :
-take a list of a number 
-Set positive Count to 0
-Set negative Count to 0
-For each number in the list
-if the number >0 
-Increase positive Count by 1
- else
-Increase negative Count by 1
-end if 
-end for
-Show positive Count and negative Count as the result
-end algorithm 


Task 5:
-Take a list of numbers
-Create a new empty list called new list
-Look at each number in the original list
-If the number is not in new list 
-Add it to new list 
-Show new list 
-End Algorithm

Task 6 :
-take a list of number
-creat new empty list called prime list
-for each number in list 
-if the number is divisible only by itself or 1 
-if yes add number to prime list
-end if 
-end for
-show prime list
- end algorithm
