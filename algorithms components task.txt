task 1 :
input  : A list of numbers
variables : sum, count , average ,i
loop: (Loop to go through all elements in the list and calculate the sum)
output : The average of all numbers.

Task2 :
input: A number
output:  "Even" or "odd"
Variables: numbe
If condition: Used to check divisibility by 2
if number is divisible by 2
Based on the result:
If yes → output "Even"
Else → output "Odd"


Task3 :
input: The input is a list of numbers
output:The smallest number
Variables: min, i, n
loop: A loop is required to go through each element in the list.
Each element is compared with the current minimum value.
if condition:
if the current element is smaller than min
If the condition is true:
min is updated with the new smaller value.

Task4:
input: a list of numbers
output: Count of positive numbers
Count of negative numbers
variable: positiveCount, negativeCount, i, n
loop: A loop is required to iterate through all elements in the list.
Each number is checked individually.
If Condition:
if the number is greater than 0 → positive
else the number is less than 0 → negative
